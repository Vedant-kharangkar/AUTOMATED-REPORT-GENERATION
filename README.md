# DESCRIPTION OF TASK

# 📝 Automated Report Generation

## 📌 Project Overview

**Automated Report Generation** is a Python-based, data-driven project that simulates real-world business reporting workflows.  
It reads structured data from a CSV file, performs analysis, generates visualizations, and compiles all insights into a **well-formatted PDF report** — automatically.

Using open-source libraries like **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **FPDF**, this script processes stock market data, produces statistical summaries and charts, and outputs a **clean, multi-page PDF**.

> 🎯 **Goal**: Automate repetitive reporting tasks and turn raw data into meaningful, human-readable documentation without manual effort.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

> **Develop a script that reads data from a file, analyzes it, and generates a formatted PDF report using libraries like `FPDF` or `ReportLab`.**

---

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Language**: Python 3  
- **Libraries**:
  - `Pandas` – For loading, cleaning, and analyzing data  
  - `Matplotlib` – For creating line and bar charts  
  - `FPDF` – For generating multi-page PDF reports  
- **Dataset Source**: `kagglehub` to load real stock data  
- **Editor**: Google Colab (cloud-based Jupyter notebook)

---

## 🔄 Workflow

### ✅ Step 1: Load Real-World Data
- Load AAPL stock data (`AAPL.csv`) from Kaggle using `kagglehub`  
- Dataset includes: date, open/close prices, volume, etc.

### ✅ Step 2: Data Preprocessing
- Convert `Date` column to datetime  
- Sort data chronologically  
- Calculate 20-day and 50-day **moving averages**

### ✅ Step 3: Data Analysis with Pandas
Generate the following insights:
- 📊 Average closing price  
- 📈 Maximum & minimum prices  
- 🕒 Latest trading date and closing price  
- 📉 Total volume traded  

### ✅ Step 4: Data Visualization with Matplotlib
Create two charts:
- 📈 **Line chart** of closing prices + 20-day & 50-day moving averages  
- 📊 **Bar chart** showing trading volume for the last 10 days  

### ✅ Step 5: PDF Report Generation
Using a class-based wrapper around `FPDF`:
- 📝 Add report title & headings  
- 📋 Insert statistics & summaries  
- 🖼 Embed generated charts  
- 📑 Display last 10 days in tabular format  
- 📤 Export report as a `.pdf` file

---

## 💼 Applicability

This project can be used for:

- 📈 **Stock & Financial Analysis**  
- 📊 **Business Dashboards & Reports**  
- 🏥 **Healthcare trend summaries**  
- 📑 **Academic research reporting**  
- 🔍 **Audit & compliance documentation**

> Automating repetitive reporting can save countless hours in domains that rely on daily/weekly/monthly summaries.

---

## 🖥️ Code Editor Used

Developed entirely in **Google Colab**, a browser-based Jupyter notebook environment.

### ✅ Benefits of Google Colab:
- No setup required  
- Free access to GPUs/TPUs (if needed)  
- Easy sharing & collaboration  
- Integration with Google Drive  

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- 🔄 Integrate live stock data APIs (e.g., Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance)  
- 🛠 Allow users to choose custom stocks or date ranges  
- 📧 Add email automation to send reports directly  
- 🌐 Export reports to **HTML** or **Word** formats  

---

## 📌 Final Thoughts

With just a few lines of Python, this project **automates a task usually done manually** in businesses and organizations.  
Whether it's stock data, sales reports, or experimental results — this framework helps streamline the reporting process, saving **time, effort, and errors**.
